_s
===

Hi. I'm a fork of the starter theme called _s. I'm a template theme meant to be the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

## Requirements

`_s` requires the following dependencies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Quick Start

### Docker DEV Environment (optional)

Move the `/docker` folder to the root of the project's installation and set parameters in the `.env` file.

1. Replace `PROJECT_NAME` with the current project name.
2. Replace `PROJECT_ABBR` with the project's abbreviation. This is used as DB table prefix. Default is `wp`.
3. Replace `DEV_URL_WITHOUT_SCHEMA` with the project's dev URL without `http://`. This should be the live URL with `dev.` instead of `www.`: dev.project.de
4. Replace `STAGE_URL_WITH_SCHEMA` with the project's stage URL.
5. Replace `LIVE_URL_WITH_SCHEMA` with the project's live URL.

6. Maybe adjust `WORDPRESS_ROOT` path if the WordPress installation isn't project's root.

For further Docker installation see docker/README.md

### Theme

Change the theme's name "_s" to something else (like, say, `next-awesome-theme`), and then you'll need to do a five-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.

1. Search for `'_s'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain and replace with: `'next-awesome-theme'`.
2. Search for `_s_` to capture all the functions names and replace with: `megatherium_is_awesome_`.
3. Search for `Text Domain: _s` in `css/style.scss` and replace with: `Text Domain: next-awesome-theme`.
4. Search for `_s.pot` and replace with: `next-awesome-theme.pot`.
5. Search for `_s-` to capture prefixed handles and replace with: `next-awesome-theme-`.

Then, update the stylesheet header in `css/style.scss` and rename `_s.pot` from `languages` folder to use the theme's slug.

## Setup

To start using all the tools that come with `_s`  you need to install the necessary Node.js dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Development

`_s` comes with CLI commands tailored for WordPress theme development:

### Available CLI commands

- `npm run watch` : watches _all_ SASS and JS files and recompiles them when they change.
- `npm run build` : compiles _all_ SASS and JS files for production use.

### Icon font

You can easily create your own icon font. Put all your svg icons in `/media/fonts/Icont/icons`
and run `npm run icont:generate`.

List all your icons (alphabetical order) in `/css/_variables.scss` to create a map
to convenient access the content declaration of the icons: e.g. `map-get($Icont, NAME)`;

### Utilities

`_s` comes packed with a bunch of CSS, JS and PHP helpers. For further information see files itself.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Never ever change anything in the utilities folder!**
> This folder is used cross-project and should be updated from time to time. All changes would be overridden.
> Please contact the _administrator_ if you discover problems or have ideas for improvement.
